## Current Projects
### Masters Research
- Looking at the fungal pathogen responsible for White Nose Syndrome (WNS) in bats (_Pseudogymnoascus destructans_)
  - WNS results in a high mortality rate in overwintering bats
  - currently affects bats in the United States and Canada
    - rapid population declines of certain bat species
    - some bat species are at risk of extinction
  - learn more about <a href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/" target="_blank">WNS here!</a>
- I will be analyzing the population genomics of _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ using:
  - genome analyses
  - estimating relatedness with phylogenic trees
  - landscape genomics to look at gene flow barriers

## Past Projects
### Undergrad Senior Year Research Project
Effects of Various Fungal Pathogens on _Trachymyrmex septentrionalis_ Ants and their Fungal Cultivars

- This research was funded by the Office of Undergraduate Research at UConn through the OUR Supply Award

- I presented my results at UConnâ€™s Annual Undergraduate Research Colloquium in MCB and at the Frontiers in Undergraduate Research Poster Exhibition in April 2024

### Leafcutter Ant Behavior Website
I made a website for a class project that incorporated animal behavior and knowledge about my lab's model system: leafcutter ants and their fungal cultivars
