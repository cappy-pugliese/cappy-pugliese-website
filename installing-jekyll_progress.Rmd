## installing jekyll

### First problem

  <p>Originally had difficulty directly installing jekyll from the command line bc of write permission errors. </p>
<p>- tried to problem solve by manually changing write permissions <br>
  - worked at first but then ran into other issues <br>
  - had to download one thing and then maybe something else </p>

### Second problem

<p>Need to update ruby to a specific version </p>
<p>- had to install homebrew <br>
- had to install rbenv<br>
- need to install ruby-build --> apparently it was already installed
- installed ruby version 3.2.5<br>
  - having trouble installing jekyll using the newly installed ruby version
  - it is still using the older ruby version, idk why
