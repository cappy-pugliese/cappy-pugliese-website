## installing jekyll

<p>Originally had difficulty directly installing jekyll from the command line bc of write permission errors. </p>
<p>- tried to problem solve by manually changing write permissions <br>
  - worked at first but then ran into other issues <br>
  - had to download one thing and then maybe something else </p>

Next issue
