## Cappy Pugliese (they/them)
I an Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Masters student at the University of Connecticut. I am currently working in the [Dagilis lab](https://dagilislab.github.io/DagilisLab) focusing on the pathogenic fungus responsible for White-Nose Bat Syndrome, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_. I also completed my undergrad at UConn in the [Klassen lab](https://www.jonathanklassenlab.com/) where I researched pathogenic fungi within the attini ant-fungi symbiosis. [(see more about my current and previous lab work here)](link)



I originally went to grad school aiming for a career in ecological field work, but am now leaning towards a career in science education or outreach.

maybe move some of this stuff into the projects section, and talk more about myself?? like hobbies and interests and stuff?? mention what im wanting to do after grad school??
