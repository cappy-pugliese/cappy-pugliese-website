## Cappy Pugliese (they/them)
I an Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Masters student at the University of Connecticut. I am currently working in the [Dagilis lab](https://dagilislab.github.io/DagilisLab) focusing on the pathogenic fungus responsible for White-Nose Bat Syndrome, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_. I also completed my undergrad at UConn in the [Klassen lab](https://www.jonathanklassenlab.com/) where I researched pathogenic fungi within the attini ant-fungi symbiosis. [(see more about my current and previous lab work here)](/projects) 

## Career Directions
Currently, I am thinking about becoming either a middle school science teacher or doing science outreach. I really love working with kids and want to be able to spread the joy of science to young, creative minds.

## Fun Facts
- I have a cat named Spidey and I like to take him with me on hikes!
- I like to play video games (I love zelda)
- I am currently learning how to speak Portuguese and ASL!
