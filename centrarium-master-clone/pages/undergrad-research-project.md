<h2><p style="text-align: center;">Effects of Various Fungal Pathogens on <i>Trachymyrmex septentrionalis</i> Ants and their Fungal Cultivars</p></h2>

<h3><p style="text-align: center;">Experiment Overview</p></h3>

I conducted 2 separate infection experiments with 6 different types of pathogenic fungi genera: _Escovopsis, Syncephalastrum, Fusarium, Metarhizium, Beauveria,_ and _Trichoderma_ (plus a control group). One infection experiment was run on the antâ€™s fungal gardens without the ants present, and the second experiment was conducted with the ants present. Measurements of the fungal garden weights, food incorporation, and trash production were collected over the course of a week and a half after infection. I made graphs of the collected data in R, and presented my work at the Annual MCB Undergraduate Symposium and UConn Frontiers Poster Presentation Events.
