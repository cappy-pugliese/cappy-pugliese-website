We ran this activity with the 4th grade classrooms at Natchaug Elementary School


### Presentation and class discussion
- we asked the students what they knew about animal adaptations
- they knew a lot of examples and were excited to tell us what they have learned


### Predator-prey adaptations activity
- we took the kids outside the classroom to play a game
- they had a lot of fun because they were able to run around while still learning
- game info and <a href="/assets/documents/4th-grade-animal-adaptations-activity.pdf" target="_blank">instructions can be found here</a>
