We ran this activity with the 3rd grade classrooms at Natchaug Elementary School

### Presentation and class discussion
- we asked the students to name some animals that lived in the ocean
- then we discussed the different layers of the ocean
- we also talked about and gave examples of the types of animals that lived in each of the layers


### Ocean in a bottle class activity
- after teaching and discussing, we did an "ocean in a bottle" craft with them
- it allowed the kids to learn about density, liquid layers, and water currents
- the kids loved doing the craft since it made them feel like real scientists
